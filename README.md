# Simple Starter
This is my basic starter for anyone wanting to build in React with webpack and babel.  As able to use as a command line starter such as create-react-app. Instructions on that coming soon.

# install

Simply type "npm install", "npm run build" and "npm start" and you're ready to go with your simple React starter, complete with babel and webpack
